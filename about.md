My name is Henry Widd, I am an independent software consultant who has been developing software for over 15 years, mostly in the financial and aerospace domains. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-widd-ab33674/) for more info. 


I am a contributor to Clojurescript (the compiler) and had many PR's accepted elsewhere. I am author of the first cross-platform Clojure(Script) date/time library [cljc.java-time](https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time) (and its companion [time-literals](https://github.com/henryw374/time-literals)) and co-author of [tick](https://github.com/juxt/tick).

### Contact

Please contact me to discuss contracts, either relating to my Clojure time libraries or anything else!
